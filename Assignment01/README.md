 # DH110-UX

## Zero Hunger Project 
### Victoria Delk in DH110 

I hope this project can spread awareness and concern for the large nmber of malnurished people worldwide. It's easy to get cought up in the bubble that is UCLA and forget about the food insucerties many face on a dirly basis. According to the United Nations the number of people who suffer from malnurishment and hunger has actually been increasing for the past 7 years, due to man made enviormental impact and climate change. If we were to stay on the trach we are currently on, by 2030 over 840 million people will be affected by hunger. I dont think this is a topic that gains the attention it deserves, so I hope this project can shed some light on the importance of solving this tragety.

### Site Description
This website highlights the severity of food insecurity worldwide and backs up its claims with facts and figures. This statistical branch of the UN (UN stats) works to compile statistical data worldwide to advance the global statistical system and improve people's lives. The Particular article I have chosen is very thorough in its data analysis and includes information on a number of nations. It presents its data using numbers and charts and cites many scientific studies when making claims.  It explains how accomplishing the "Zero Hunger" goal will come with the improvement in sustainable agriculture, equal access to land and technology, and certain increased investments.

##Overall Evaluation
Overall, I felt this website did a good job of providing the necessary statistics for the Zero Hunger SUstainable goal. I found the charts to be extremely useful for visualizing the information. However, I found the information to be a little dense and quite statistical. For this reason, I think this website of best for someone already focused on this sustainable goal rather than someone new to learn about food insecurity. Overall, I would rate this website an 8/10 because it has a lot of very useful information conveyed in a pretty good way, I just think it could cater to a broader audience.
