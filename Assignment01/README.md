## Zero Hunger Project 
### Victoria Delk in DH110 

I hope this project can spread awareness and concern for the large nmber of malnurished people worldwide. It's easy to get cought up in the bubble that is UCLA and forget about the food insucerties many face on a dirly basis. According to the United Nations the number of people who suffer from malnurishment and hunger has actually been increasing for the past 7 years, due to man made enviormental impact and climate change. If we were to stay on the trach we are currently on, by 2030 over 840 million people will be affected by hunger. I dont think this is a topic that gains the attention it deserves, so I hope this project can shed some light on the importance of solving this tragety.

This website highlights the sevarity of food inscirity worldwide and backs up their claims with facts and figures. This statistical branch of he UN (UN stats) works to compile statistical data worldwide to advance the global statistical system and improve peoples lives. The Particualar artical I have chosen is very through in their data analysis and incluses information on a number of nations.It presents its data using both numbers and charts and cites many scientific studys when making claims.  It explains how acomplishing the "Zero Hunger" goal will come with the improvemnt in suatainable agriculture, equal access to land and technology, and certain increased investments.
